# LeagueAnalysis

I developed this project in order to analyze who would win a League of Legends game using statistics at the end of the match. I ended up with quite good results, with my model being able to predict the correct winner of a League of Legends game 98% of the time. For more discussion of these results and other analyses, look at "Erik Final Project.pdf"
